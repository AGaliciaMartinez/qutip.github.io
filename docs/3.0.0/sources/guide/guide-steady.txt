Introduction
============

For open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty` that satisfies the equation

:math:`\frac{\partial\rho_{ss}}{\partial t}=\mathcal{L}\rho_{ss}=0`.

For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix :math:`\rho_{ss}` can be achieved using a direct or iterative methods faster than master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate`.  This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, and the method used can be chosen using the `method` keyword argument. Some of the implemented methods include `direct`, `iterative` and `power`. For details, see the API documentation for :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate`. The :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate` can take either a Hamiltonian and a list of collapse operators as input, or alternative a Liouvillian. When possible, we recommend passing the Hamiltonian and the collapse operators to :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate`, and the function will then automatically build the Liouvillian for the system.


.. _steady-usage:

Using the Steadystate Solver
=============================

Solving for the steady state of a general system with :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate` can be accomplished using::

>>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops)

where ``H`` is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and ``c_ops`` is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The output, labeled as ``rho_ss``, is the steady-state solution for the systems. Although this method will produce the required solution in most situations, there are additional options that may be set if the algorithm does not converge properly.  These optional parameters may be used by calling the steady-state solver as::

>>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method, maxiter, tol, use_umfpack, use_precond)

where ``maxiter`` is the maximum number of iterations performed by the solver, ``tol`` is the requested solution tolerance, and ``method`` indicates whether the linear equation solver uses a direct solver "solve" or an iterative stabilized bi-conjugate gradient "bicg" solution method.  In general, the direct solver is faster, but takes more memory than the iterative method.  The advantage of the iterative method is the memory efficiency of this routine, allowing for extremely large system sizes. The downside is that it takes much longer than the direct method, especially when the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is large, as typically occurs.  To overcome this, the steady state solvers also include a preconditioner that attempts to normalize the condition number of the system.  This incomplete LU preconditioner is invoked by using the "use_precond=True" flag in combination with the iterative solver.  As a first try, it is recommended to begin with the direct solver before using the ``direct`` method.  More information on these options may be found in the :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate` section of the API documentation.

This solver can also use a Liouvillian constructed from a Hamiltonian and collapse operators as input::

>>> rho_ss = steadystate(L)

where ``L`` is the Louvillian.

.. _steady-example:

Example: Harmonic Oscillator in Thermal Bath
============================================

A simple example of a system that reaches a steady state is a harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal environment.  Below we consider a harmonic oscillator, initially in a :math:`\left|10\right>` number state, and weakly coupled to a thermal environment characterized by an average particle expectation value of :math:`\left<n\right>=2`.  We calculate the evolution via master equation and Monte Carlo methods, and see that they converge to the steady-state solution.  Here we choose to perform only a few Monte Carlo trajectories so we can distinguish this evolution from the master-equation solution.
